Versions
========
This is the latest version of the documentation and is generated from the latest commit on the `main branch <https://github.com/nikipore/stompest>`_. If you are looking for documentation which is consistent to a specific release, you may download the corresponding `tarball <https://github.com/nikipore/stompest/tags>`_ for offline browsing. If someone is willing to (teach me how to) set up release specific documentation on PyPI, please go ahead!
